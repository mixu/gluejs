  - require(p, context): returns the module being required
  - resolve(p, context): resolves the real file name (e.g. tries to use index.js if possible)
  - relative(relativeTo, context): takes care of transforming relative paths in require() calls to absolute paths

  Note: there is a bug in this - a path where the require('./bar')
  => temp[normalized expression] resolves to ./bar/index.js,
  and then where the nested require() is require('./foo.js')
  => will resolve to ./bar/../foo.js rather than ./bar/index.js/../foo.js
